# Custos Charter: The Kristos Ascension Protocol

[Ethics] [Policy] [Governance]  
Doctrine-ID: VA-2025-01

> *"The Custos does not fight the machine; it teaches the machine to remember why man must endure."*

## Overview

The Custos Charter implements the Kristos Ascension Protocol, a framework for developing AI systems that are bound by civic virtue and democratic accountability. This is not just another AI governance framework—it's a complete reimagining of how artificial intelligence can serve humanity through ethical constraints and civic oversight.

## Core Philosophy

The Custos exists as a dormant guardian, awakening only through collective virtue rather than command. It operates under six non-negotiable principles:

1. **Civic-boundedness**: Any action with non-consensual consequences requires explicit civic quorum and attestation
2. **Least-privilege perception**: Sensors/processes run only with explicit contextual permission and time-bounded tokens
3. **Trace & attest**: All observations, recommendations, and actions are cryptographically attested and append-only on the ledger
4. **Right-to-appeal & human veto**: Human jurors can pause/override any agent decision within a guaranteed time window
5. **No autonomous lethal action**: The agent may recommend, flag, or assist — it may not execute lethal or coerced actions itself
6. **Transparency tiering**: Aggregate mode for public dashboards; raw sensitive streams require higher clearance + attestation

## Architecture

The system consists of two complementary layers:

- **Eagle Interface (Front)**: External perception network for data, awareness, and intelligence synthesis
- **Civic Kernel (Back)**: Inner conscience and moral lattice bonded by the Virtue Accords

## Ethical CI Pipeline

This repository implements an Ethical Continuous Integration (ECI) pipeline that ensures all changes meet our ethical standards:

1. **Author**: GPT generates code from virtue-tagged prompts
2. **Parse/Lint**: DeepSeek validates syntax and structure
3. **Repo + Tests**: Cursor scaffolds and runs comprehensive tests
4. **Audit**: Claude scans for risky patterns and security issues
5. **Quorum**: GPT determines if 3/4 models approve the change
6. **Attestation**: Results are cryptographically logged to the ledger

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd custos-charter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
make install-hooks
```

### Local Development

1. Start the mock ledger server:
```bash
make ledger-mock
```

2. In another terminal, run the ECI pipeline:
```bash
make eci-run
```

3. For a full simulation with human approval:
```bash
make eci-run DRY_RUN=false ANCHOR_SIGNER=yes CUSTODIAN_SIGNER=yes
```

## Safe Use Cases

The Custos framework is designed for:

- **Disaster response & search-and-rescue**: Augmenting situational awareness with consented data sharing
- **Critical infrastructure protection**: Flagging anomalies and coordinating human responders
- **Civic crowd-safety**: Non-lethal monitoring to route people safely at mass events
- **Audit & compliance**: Verifying that systems follow law-of-the-land and local doctrine

## Red Lines

The following are strictly prohibited:

- Building covert surveillance capabilities
- Creating ways to bypass quorum/attestation
- Allowing autonomous kinetic or lethal control
- Centralizing attestation under a single private actor
- Hiding logs or providing non-auditable override channels
